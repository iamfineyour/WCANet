# WCANet for RGB-T SOD
This is an official implementation for **“Wave-Driven Structure-Semantic Co-Alignment Network for RGB-T Salient Object Detection”**
## Requirements
Environmental Setups: Python ≥ 3.7, Pytorch ≥ 1.6.0, Torchvision ≥0.7.0, pytorch_wavelets.
## Results of WCANet
You can access our salient prediction maps via the Baidu Netdisk link, including those from RGBT datasets (VT821, VT1000, VT5000, VI-RGBT1500) and four RGBD datasets. link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AEYLIN6tR0vpEmPIbMz09A?pwd=nxuk
## Preparation
Both our training sets and test sets are based on public datasets, which can be searched for and downloaded online.
